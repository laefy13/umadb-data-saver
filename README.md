# Chrome extension for umadb
iykyk, but hol up for this. 

i will leave the console.logs for now. 

npm is only needed if u want to have the auto complete in vscode or other compatible ides

for now, to have the extension, clone the repo and [load the unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked)
